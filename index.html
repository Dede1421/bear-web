  <h1>The real life Paddington bear</h1>

      <h2>Despite defying so many expectations, meet the bear that still faces a serious image problem.</h2>
      <p>Serving as the inspiration for the beloved worldwide phenomenon Paddington Bear, the Andean bear (Tremarctos
        ornatus) is a remarkable animal. The only bear species found in South America, many (but not all) of them have
        rings of coloured fur around their eyes ranging from whitish to yellowish. This makes it look like they’re
        wearing their own pair of au natural glasses giving rise to their other name of ‘spectacled bears’.</p>

      <p>Unlike their fictional, marmalade-sandwich-obsessed counterpart, the Andean bear is not a social animal. They
        tend to live alone, only coming together for the mating season, which lasts from April to June. Andean bears are
        polyestrous, meaning they are have more than one period of fertility in a year. As a result, they are capable of
        delayed implantation. This means female bears are able to push pause on embryo development until a time when
        food is abundant - usually between November and February.</p>
