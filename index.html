  <h1>The real life Paddington bear</h1>
  <main>
    <div>
      <p>Serving as the inspiration for the beloved worldwide phenomenon Paddington Bear, the Andean bear (Tremarctos
        ornatus) is a remarkable animal. The only bear species found in South America, many (but not all) of them have
        rings of coloured fur around their eyes ranging from whitish to yellowish. This makes it look like they’re
        wearing their own pair of au natural glasses giving rise to their other name of ‘spectacled bears’.</p>
